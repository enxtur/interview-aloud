Concurrency means handling multiple tasks by interleaving their execution.
Parallelism means running multiple tasks at the same time on multiple CPU cores.
A system can be concurrent without being parallel, such as a single-core CPU.
Parallelism always involves concurrency, but not the other way around.
Concurrency improves responsiveness and structure.
Parallelism improves speed and throughput.
