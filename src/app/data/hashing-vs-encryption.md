Hashing and encryption are both used to protect data, but they serve different purposes.
Hashing is a one-way process and cannot be reversed.
Encryption is a two-way process and can be reversed using a key.
Hashing is commonly used for storing passwords securely.
Encryption is used when data needs to be recovered later.
Hash functions always produce the same output for the same input.
Encrypted data can produce different outputs depending on the key.
