A closure is a function that remembers variables from its outer lexical scope.
This access remains even after the outer function has finished executing.
Closures exist because JavaScript uses lexical scoping.
They are commonly used for data encapsulation and state preservation.
Closures are also useful in callbacks and asynchronous code.
